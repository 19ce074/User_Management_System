## Run this project on your machine

### Prerequisites
+ [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)^14.0.2
+ [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
+ [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
+ [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)

Notice, You need client and server running concurrently in different terminal session, in order to make them talk with each other.

### Server-side usage(PORT:8000)
    $ cd server/
    npm i
    npm start

>It will automatically install all the dependencies from the package.json file of server folder.

### Client-side usage(PORT:5000)
     $ cd client/
     npm i
     npm start

>It will automatically install all the dependencies from the package.json file of client folder.

Note: You need to connect your own mongodb database and so you need to edit url in the db.js file inside the database folder in the server directory.
